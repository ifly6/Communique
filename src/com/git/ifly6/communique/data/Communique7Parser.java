 * <p><code>Communique7Parser</code> also provides methods to translate between the old and new Communique address
 * tokens, allowing for a seamless transition between the old and new token systems.</p>
 * <p>This class does not lazily load data. When invoking <code>apply</code>, all elements are processed
 * immediately. This class is meant to be used fluently, e.g.
 * <code>new Communique7Parser().apply(tokens).listRecipients()</code>.</p>

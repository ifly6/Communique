/**
 * Classes related to the implementation of the {@link Communiqué Communiqué} recipients system, specifications, and
 * starting classes for its implementation.
 *
 * <p>
 * The package contains six classes: <code>Communiqué</code>, which launches the GUI; {@link CommuniquéController},
 * which processes the data and the user input from the GUI; {@link CommuniquéFileReader CommuniquéFileReader}, which
 * checks version, comments, and loads the relevant data into memory; {@link CommuniquéFileWriter CommuniquéFileWriter},
 * which writes the files which <code>CommuniquéFileReader</code> will have to read; {@link CommuniquéParser
 * CommuniquéParser}, whose parsing system defines the grammar (and thus, the version) of the Communiqué recipients
 * language (and processes that information); and finally, {@link CommuniquéLogger CommuniquéLogger}, which interfaces
 * with JavaTelegram to return relevant information to Communiqué.

/** <code>CConfig</code> creates a unified object for the storage and retrieval of the entire state of a Communiqué
 * application.
 *
 * <p>
 * Because it is needed to be able to send all the Communiqué flags and relevant assorted information as a single
 * object, this object was created as an integrated system to do so. This program also contains methods to access the
 * interior components of this class using a <code>Map</code> for cross-interoperability with
 * <code>{@link com.git.ifly6.communique.io.CommuniqueLoader CLoader}</code>,
 * <code>{@link com.git.ifly6.communique.io.CommuniqueReader CReader}</code>, and
 * <code>{@link com.git.ifly6.communique.io.CommuniqueWriter CWriter}</code>, which are based on the Java properties file system.
 * Also, the widespread use of reflection in dealing with a <code>Map{@code <String, String>}</code> will allow for
 * greater extensibility over time and significantly less human error in providing methods to access such data.
 * </p>

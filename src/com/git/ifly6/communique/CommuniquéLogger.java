/*
 * This class here is designed to be an instance of an object which can be called upon for sending.
 * It is not static, since having it as static would likely mean an annoying amount of code. Hence,
 * with instances, it can be called from anywhere, and thus, have multiple front-ends. The purpose
 * of this was so multiple front-ends could be built -- a GUI or CLI -- and thus, solve problems
 * much easier than if they were hardcoded for one another.

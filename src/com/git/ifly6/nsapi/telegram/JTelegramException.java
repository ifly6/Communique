/**
 * <code>JTelegramException</code> indicates conditions that an application might want to catch when related to issues
 * which can only be created by a failure to sanitise data which is recognised by <code>JavaTelegram</code>.
 * <p>
 * Proper use of this class is to catch an <code>Exception</code> which would arise, but can only arise due to a failure
 * to handle data correctly. The purpose of this class is to replace the use of <code>catch (Exception e)</code> in code
 * for the purpose of being more accurate in cases where an <code>IOException</code> could also occur.

 * This class was created to extend JavaTelegram's functionalities. Instead of calling methods inside JavaTelegram which

 * so the class would be called with some extra methods which would not affect some other programmer's attempts to call
 * JavaTelegram directly. By moving the implementation code out of JavaTelegram, the Morse implementation is no longer
 * tied into JavaTelegram itself.
